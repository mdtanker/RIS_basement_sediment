# Depth to magnetic basement beneath Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf

This repository accompanies our 2022 Geophysical Research Letters article *Basement topography and sediment thickness beneath Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf*.

Here we document our scientific workflow in a Jupyter notebook, present our gridded results as netCDF files, and showcase our figures created using PyGMT.

The main body of this work centers on the Werner deconvolution of airborne magnetics data from a 10km grid of flight line data (ROSETTA-Ice) over the Ross Ice Shelf. The deconvolution and subsequent filtering/binning of the results give a magnetic basement surface, which represents to contact between non-magnetic sediments/sedimentary rocks and underlying crystalline basement.
